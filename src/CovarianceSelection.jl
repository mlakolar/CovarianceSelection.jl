    CovarianceSelection

Methods for learning high-dimensional Gaussian graphical models:

* CLIME and ACLIME, sparse precision matrices by constrained ℓ1 minimization
  ([`clime`](@ref), [`aclime`](@ref)), with cross validation
  ([`climecv`](@ref), [`aclimecv`](@ref)) and a choice of solvers
  ([`CLIMESolver`](@ref));
* the precision matrix by the scaled lasso of each column, which needs no
  tuning ([`slassoinv`](@ref));
* the graphical lasso by ADMM ([`covsel!`](@ref), [`covselpath`](@ref));
* the fused graphical lasso for K groups ([`fusedGraphicalLasso`](@ref)) and
  fused neighborhood selection ([`fusedNeighborhoodSelection`](@ref));
* K precision matrices with a shared sparsity pattern, the group graphical
  lasso ([`groupGraphicalLasso`](@ref)), and graphs that vary over time by
  kernel smoothing ([`tvCovSel`](@ref), [`kernelCovariances`](@ref));
* direct estimation of the difference of two precision matrices by coordinate
  descent ([`differencePrecisionActiveShooting`](@ref),
  [`differencePrecisionRefit`](@ref)) or iterative hard thresholding, with an
  optional low rank component ([`differencePrecisionIHT`](@ref),
  [`differenceLatentPrecisionIHT`](@ref)).

The losses and penalties are those of ProximalBase, and the graphical lasso and
the direct difference estimator are solved by the ADMM and the coordinate
descent of ProximalSolvers. Before its first release the package was called
CovSel.
