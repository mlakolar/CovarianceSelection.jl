# Parametric simplex method for the column problems of CLIME and ACLIME.
#
# For column i, the linear program is
#
#     minimize ‖β‖₁  subject to  |(Sβ - eᵢ)ⱼ| ≤ cⱼ (μ + γ βᵢ),  j = 1, …, p,          (Pμ)
#
# with constraint weights c > 0 and γ ≥ 0. CLIME has c = 1 and γ = 0, and step 2
# of ACLIME has cⱼ = √σⱼⱼ and γ = 0. Step 1 of ACLIME, whose bounds grow with βᵢ,
# is (P₀) with γ = λₙ and cⱼ = σⱼⱼ ∨ σᵢᵢ.
#
# μ only enters the right-hand side, so the solution is piecewise linear in μ. The
# parametric (dual) simplex method follows it from μ = 1/cᵢ, where β = 0, down to
# the smallest μ asked for: the basis stays optimal until a basic variable reaches a
# bound, and a dual simplex pivot then replaces that variable (Vanderbei, 2020,
# Chapter 7; Pang, Liu and Vanderbei, 2014). Each pivot is one breakpoint of the
# path.
#
# In the standard form, with β = u - v and a slack for each of the 2p one-sided
# constraints, the basis is a 2p × 2p matrix, but all its columns except those of
# the active variables A are unit vectors. Everything the method needs comes from
# the k × k block M = G[R, A], where R are the tight constraints (|R| = |A| = k) and
# row (j, s) of G, for the side s = ±1 of constraint j, is
#
#     G[(j, s), l] = Sⱼₗ - s γ cⱼ [l == i].
#
# The workspace keeps N = M⁻¹, updated after each pivot in O(k²) operations. The
# other work of a pivot is two products of k columns of S with a vector, so a pivot
# costs O(pk) and a column with s nonzero entries O(p s²) in total.
#
# Notation: β_A = a + μ b on A; the residual r = Sβ - eᵢ = r0 + μ r1; the dual
# variable η of the tight constraints solves M'η = τ (τ the signs of β_A), and
# σ = G[R, :]'η, with |σ| ≤ 1 and σ_A = τ at an optimal basis. The slack of side s of
# constraint j is z = cⱼ (μ + γ βᵢ) - s rⱼ.
