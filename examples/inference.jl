# Inference for one entry of the difference of two precision matrices when
# p > n, checked by simulation: under the null hypothesis the standardized
# difference should be approximately N(0, 1).
#
# This ports the Gaussian case of ROCKET (Barber and Kolar, 2018, Annals of
# Statistics) from the unmaintained mlakolar/ROCKET.jl. For an edge (a, b) and
# one sample, regress the variables a and b on the others, select their
# neighborhoods with the square-root lasso, and refit by least squares on the
# union of the two neighborhoods. The residuals ε have covariance close to
# inv(Ω[[a, b], [a, b]]), so
#
#   Ω̂[[a, b], [a, b]] = inv(ε'ε / n),   Var(Ω̂[a, b]) ≈ (Ω[a, a] Ω[b, b] + Ω[a, b]²) / n.
#
# (Least squares on all p - 2 other variables, as in the original script, is
# not possible with p > n.)
#
# Run from the repository root (see examples/README.md for the setup):
#
#   julia --project=examples examples/inference.jl
#
# The default p = 500, n = 400 and 500 replications takes a few seconds;
# COVSEL_EXAMPLES_QUICK=1 selects a smaller setting.
